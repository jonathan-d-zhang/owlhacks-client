<h3>Description</h3>
 This application is responsible for recording a 5 second audio file for the duration of the lecture and sending the information to the Server Side
 
 We used the application this way because we wanted to make the client responsible for controling when the recording starts and stops
 
 We are currently working with the UI so we have a interface that both the students and the professors can interact
 <ul>
 <li>The professor are able to create a room for the students to join, start, and end the recording based on the UI</li>
 <li>The students are able to join the room that the professor created, view the live transcript with the translation, and adjust font size and font style</li>
 </ul>
 
 We faced many challenges in this side of the project, such as start the recording, stop the recording and restarting it and send that file to the server
