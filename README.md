<h3>Description</h3>
 <br>This application is responsible for recording a 5 second audio file for the duration of the lecture and sending the information to the Server Side</br>
 
 <br>We used the application this way because we wanted to make the client responsible for controling when the recording starts and stops</br>
 
 We are currently working with the UI so we have a interface that both the students and the professors can interact
 <ul>
 <li>The professor are able to create a room for the students to join, start, and end the recording based on the UI</li>
 <li>The students are able to join the room that the professor created, view the live transcript with the translation, and adjust font size and font style</li>
 </ul>
 
 We faced many challenges in this side of the project, such as start the recording, stop the recording and restarting it and send that file to the server
